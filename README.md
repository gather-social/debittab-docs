## What is DebitTab
### DebitTab Vouchers
A DebitTab Voucher is a one-time-use bearer instrument. The
voucher is like a gift-certificate or gift-card but can only
be used once and does not retain a balance. The bearer of a
valid gift certificate is entitled to exchange it for goods
and services up to its face-value.

The bearer has no
implicit or explicit right to exchange the gift certificate
for cash or credit and no right for cash or credit back in
the event that it is offered to the Vendor in exchange for
goods or services that are, in total, of a price lower than
the face-value of the voucher.

Vendors may, at their own
sole discretion, in the case of an underspend, elect to give
cash or credit back as change but the vendor has no
obligation to do so.Vouchers that have expired without being
transacted have zero value.

### Vouchers expire
Yes, that's right, unlike gift-certificates and gift-cards,
DebitTab vouchers expire. The expiry time limit is chosen by
the issuer from a range set out by the vendor.

### Vouchers are transferable
Vouchers, once issued, are a bearer instrument. This means
that a valid voucher, one that has not expired, may be
brought to the vendor's place of business, during normal
operating hours, in digital or paper form, by anyone and
used almost as though it is cash.

### Fees (and taxes)
Our standard services are entirely for free for vendors. Our
issuers pay a percentage fee on the face-value of vouchers
that actually get transacted. If the voucher expires, no one
pays anything. If a voucher is transacted and a fee is paid,
the issuer also pays taxes (where applicable) only on the
fee portion.

### Disabling your account
If you wish to disable or permanently close your account
please contact your sales representative or contact
support@debittab.com for more information.

### Adding another operator account
If you wish to add a second email address and password
combination, for a second person, with permissions to use
your debittab account please contact your sales agent.

?> Please note that we have not yet implemented a
permissions system so any additional accounts we create for
you will have full ability to do everything on the system
that you can do, except close your account. Permission
control features to allow restricted employee accounts are
under development and coming soon.

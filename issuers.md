## The dashboard

### Account balances
For each currency we show you your current account totals in
a number of categories:

![Accounts information](/_media/screens/accounts.jpg ':class=screen')

* *Balance* is how much actual money you have deposited in
your account.

* *Credit Ratio* is a measure of how much leverage we allow
you to use. Talk to your account representative if you would
like to submit a credit application and request a higher
ratio.

* *Buying Power* is your balance multiplied by your credit
ratio up to your credit limit, plus hard credit. Upon
approval of a new account your buying power will likely be
$100. This is the amount of hard credit we typically grant
to new accounts. You can use this credit to issue your first
vouchers, and if they are redeemed we will invoice you.

* *Amount Owing* will be zero unless you have issued
vouchers which have been redeemed against hard credit. When
this amount is non-zero you can expect an invoice from us
per the terms of the issuer agreement.

### Vouchers
The next section of the dashboard displays the state of all
vouchers you have issued. When you first log in there will
be nothing here.

### Transaction logs
Here you will see a ledger for each currency in which you
operate, detailing every transaction on your account. Every
time you deposit or withdraw funds, and every time a voucher
is redeemed against your account, all the details will be
shown here. You will also be able to download this ledger
for convenient entry into spreadsheets or accounting
software if desired.

- **Step Four:** Enter any *tracking tags* that you want to
associate with this voucher. These will only be seen by you,
on reports and bills.

?> Tracking tags can be used to aid your bookkeeper in
categorizing the expense; for example as *marketing* or
*sales department*. You can also associate your own customer
number or invoice number with the voucher by use of these
tags

- **Step Five:** Enter a *personal message* if desired. This
message will be seen by you, the recipient, the vendor, and
anyone who has any access to the voucher.

- **Step Six:** Press *Issue Voucher* and review the details
of the voucher, then press *confirm* if everything is
correct.
